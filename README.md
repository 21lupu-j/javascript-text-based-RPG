# javascript-text-based-RPG
As I embark on my journey to learn javascript, I have a clear idea of what I want to build. A dwarven-fortress like game in javascript. 

Of course, I dont what the depth of dwarven fortress. I want the comedy of monty python and the ascii of graphics of 1986. And something that is fun.
